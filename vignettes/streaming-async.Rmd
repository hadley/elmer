### Streaming results

The `chat()` method does not return any results until the entire response is received. (It can _print_ the streaming results to the console but it _returns_ the result only when the response is complete.)

If you want to process the response as it arrives, you can use the `stream()` method. This is useful when you want to send the response, in realtime, somewhere other than the R console (e.g., to a file, an HTTP response, or a Shiny chat window), or when you want to manipulate the response before displaying it without giving up the immediacy of streaming.

With the `stream()` method, which returns a [coro](https://coro.r-lib.org/) [generator](https://coro.r-lib.org/articles/generator.html), you can process the response by looping over it as it arrives.

```{r eval=FALSE}
stream <- chat$stream("What are some common uses of R?")
coro::loop(for (chunk in stream) {
  cat(toupper(chunk))
})
#>  R IS COMMONLY USED FOR:
#>
#>  1. **STATISTICAL ANALYSIS**: PERFORMING COMPLEX STATISTICAL TESTS AND ANALYSES.
#>  2. **DATA VISUALIZATION**: CREATING GRAPHS, CHARTS, AND PLOTS USING PACKAGES LIKE  GGPLOT2.
#>  3. **DATA MANIPULATION**: CLEANING AND TRANSFORMING DATA WITH PACKAGES LIKE DPLYR AND TIDYR.
#>  4. **MACHINE LEARNING**: BUILDING PREDICTIVE MODELS WITH LIBRARIES LIKE CARET AND #>  RANDOMFOREST.
#>  5. **BIOINFORMATICS**: ANALYZING BIOLOGICAL DATA AND GENOMIC STUDIES.
#>  6. **ECONOMETRICS**: PERFORMING ECONOMIC DATA ANALYSIS AND MODELING.
#>  7. **REPORTING**: GENERATING DYNAMIC REPORTS AND DASHBOARDS WITH R MARKDOWN.
#>  8. **TIME SERIES ANALYSIS**: ANALYZING TEMPORAL DATA AND FORECASTING.
#>
#>  THESE USES MAKE R A POWERFUL TOOL FOR DATA SCIENTISTS, STATISTICIANS, AND RESEARCHERS.
```

## Asynchronous use

ellmer also supports asynchronous use. This is useful when you want to run multiple, concurrent chat sessions. This is particularly important for Shiny applications where using the methods described above would block the Shiny app for other users for the duration of each response.

To use asynchronous chat, call `chat_async()`/`stream_async()` instead of `chat()`/`stream()`. The `_async` variants take the same arguments for construction but return a promise instead of the actual response.

Remember that chat objects are stateful; they preserve the conversation history as you interact with it. This means that it doesn't make sense to issue multiple, concurrent chat/stream operations on the same chat object because the conversation history can become corrupted with interleaved conversation fragments. If you need to run concurrent chat sessions, create multiple chat objects.

### Asynchronous chat

For asynchronous, non-streaming chat, you'd use the `chat()` method as before, but handle the result as a promise instead of a string.

```{r eval=FALSE}
library(promises)

chat$chat_async("How's your day going?") %...>% print()
#> I'm just a computer program, so I don't have feelings, but I'm here to help you with any questions you have.
```

### Asynchronous streaming

For asynchronous streaming, you'd use the `stream()` method as before, but the result is an [async generator](https://coro.r-lib.org/reference/async_generator.html) from the [coro package](https://coro.r-lib.org/). This is the same as a regular [generator](https://coro.r-lib.org/articles/generator.html), except that instead of giving you strings, it gives you promises that resolve to strings.

```{r eval=FALSE}
stream <- chat$stream_async("What are some common uses of R?")
coro::async(function() {
  for (chunk in await_each(stream)) {
    cat(toupper(chunk))
  }
})()
#>  R IS COMMONLY USED FOR:
#>
#>  1. **STATISTICAL ANALYSIS**: PERFORMING VARIOUS STATISTICAL TESTS AND MODELS.
#>  2. **DATA VISUALIZATION**: CREATING PLOTS AND GRAPHS TO VISUALIZE DATA.
#>  3. **DATA MANIPULATION**: CLEANING AND TRANSFORMING DATA WITH PACKAGES LIKE DPLYR.
#>  4. **MACHINE LEARNING**: BUILDING PREDICTIVE MODELS AND ALGORITHMS.
#>  5. **BIOINFORMATICS**: ANALYZING BIOLOGICAL DATA, ESPECIALLY IN GENOMICS.
#>  6. **TIME SERIES ANALYSIS**: ANALYZING TEMPORAL DATA FOR TRENDS AND FORECASTS.
#>  7. **REPORT GENERATION**: CREATING DYNAMIC REPORTS WITH R MARKDOWN.
#>  8. **GEOSPATIAL ANALYSIS**: MAPPING AND ANALYZING GEOGRAPHIC DATA.
```

Async generators are very advanced and require a good understanding of asynchronous programming in R. They are also the only way to present streaming results in Shiny without blocking other users. Fortunately, Shiny will soon have chat components that will make this easier, where you'll simply hand the result of `stream_async()` to a chat output.
