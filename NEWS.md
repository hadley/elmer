# elmer (development version)

* `chat_browser()` and `chat_console()` are now `live_browser()` and `live_console()`.

* The `echo` can now be one of three values: "none", "text", or "all". If "all", you'll now see both user and assistant turns, and all content types will be printed, not just text. When running in the global environment, `echo` defaults to "text", and when running inside a function it defaults to "none".

* `chat$register_tool()` now takes an object created by `ToolDef()`. This makes it a little easier to reuse tool definitions (#32).

* `new_chat_openai()` is now `chat_openai()`.

* Claude and Gemini are now supported via `chat_claude()` and `chat_gemini()`.
