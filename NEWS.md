# elmer (development version)

* The default `chat_openai()` model is now GPT-4o.

* New `Chat$set_turns()` to set turns. `Chat$turns()` is now `Chat$get_turns()`. `Chat$system_prompt()` is replaced with `Chat$set_system_prompt()` and `Chat$get_system_prompt()`.

* Async and streaming async chat are now event-driven and use `later::later_fd()` to wait efficiently on curl socket activity (#157).

* New `chat_bedrock()` to chat with AWS bedrock models (#50).

* New `chat$extract_data()` uses the structured data API where available (and tool calling otherwise) to extract data structured according to a known type specification. You can create specs with functions `type_boolean()`, `type_integer()`, `type_number()`, `type_string()`, `type_enum()`, `type_array()`, and `type_object()` (#31).

* The general `ToolArg()` has been replaced by the more specific `type_*()` functions. `ToolDef()` has been renamed to `tool`.

* `content_image_url()` will now create inline images when given a data url (#110).

* Streaming ollama results works once again (#117).

* Streaming OpenAI results now capture more results, including `logprops` (#115).

* New `interpolate()` and `prompt_file()` make it easier to create prompts that are a mix of static text and dynamic values.

* You can find how many tokens you've used in the current session by calling `token_usage()`.

* `chat_browser()` and `chat_console()` are now `live_browser()` and `live_console()`.

* The `echo` can now be one of three values: "none", "text", or "all". If "all", you'll now see both user and assistant turns, and all content types will be printed, not just text. When running in the global environment, `echo` defaults to "text", and when running inside a function it defaults to "none".

* `chat$register_tool()` now takes an object created by `Tool()`. This makes it a little easier to reuse tool definitions (#32).

* `new_chat_openai()` is now `chat_openai()`.

* Claude and Gemini are now supported via `chat_claude()` and `chat_gemini()`.

* The Snowflake Cortex Analyst is now supported via `chat_cortex()` (#56).

* Databricks is now supported via `chat_databricks()` (#152).
