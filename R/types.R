#' Type specifications
#'
#' @description
#' These functions specify object types in a way that chatbots understand and
#' are used for tool calling and structured data extraction. Their names are
#' based on the [JSON schema](https://json-schema.org), which is what the APIs
#' expect behind the scenes. The translation from R concepts to these types is
#' fairly straightforward.
#'
#' * `type_boolean()`, `type_integer()`, `type_number()`, and `type_string()`
#'   each represent scalars. These are equivalent to length-1 logical,
#'   integer, double, and character vectors (respectively).
#'
#' * `type_enum()` is equivalent to a length-1 factor; it is a string that can
#'   only take the specified values.
#'
#' * `type_array()` is equivalent to a vector in R. You can use it to represent
#'   an atomic vector: e.g. `type_array(items = type_boolean())` is equivalent
#'   to a logical vector and `type_array(items = type_string())` is equivalent
#'   to a character vector). You can also use it to represent a list of more
#'   complicated types where every element is the same type (R has no base
#'   equivalent to this), e.g. `type_array(items = type_array(items = type_string()))`
#'   represents a list of character vectors.
#'
#' * `type_object()` is equivalent to a named list in R, but where every element
#'   must have the specified type. For example,
#'   `type_object(a = type_string(), b = type_array(type_integer()))` is
#'   equivalent to a list with an element called `a` that is a string and
#'   an element called `b` that is an integer vector.
#'
#' @param description,.description The purpose of the component. This is
#'   used by the LLM to determine what values to pass to the tool or what
#'   values to extract in the structured data, so the more detail that you can
#'   provide here, the better.
#' @param required,.required Is the component required? If `FALSE`, and the
#'   component does not exist in the data, the LLM may hallucinate a value.
#'   Only applies when the element is nested inside of a `type_object()`.
#' @export
#' @examples
#' # An integer vector
#' type_array(items = type_integer())
#'
#' # The closest equivalent to a data frame is an array of objects
#' type_array(items = type_object(
#'    x = type_boolean(),
#'    y = type_string(),
#'    z = type_number()
#' ))
#'
#' # There's no specific type for dates, but you use a string with the
#' # requested format in the description (it's not gauranteed that you'll
#' # get this format back, but you should most of the time)
#' type_string("The creation date, in YYYY-MM-DD format.")
#' type_string("The update date, in dd/mm/yyyy format.")
