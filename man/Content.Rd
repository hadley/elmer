\description{
elmer abstracts away differences in the way that different \link{Provider}s
represent various types of content, allowing you to more easily write
code that works with any chatbot.

This set of classes represents the various types of content that can be
sent to and received from a provider:
\itemize{
\item \code{ContentText}: simple text (often in markdown format). This is the only
type of content that can be streamed live as it's received.
\item \code{ContentImageRemote} and \code{ContentImageInline}: images, either as a pointer
to a remote URL or included inline in the object. See
\code{\link[=content_image_file]{content_image_file()}} and friends for convenient ways to construct these
objects.
\item \code{ContentToolRequest}: a request to perform a tool call (sent by the
assistant).
\item \code{ContentToolResult}: the result of calling the tool (sent by the user).
}
}
