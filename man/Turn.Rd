\description{
Every conversation with a chatbot consists of pairs of user and assistant
turns, corresponding to an HTTP request and response. These turns are
represented by the \code{Turn} object, which contains a list of \link{Content}s representing
the individual messages within the turn. These might be text, images, tool
requests (assistant only), or tool responses (user only).

Note that a call to \verb{$chat()} and related functions may result in multiple
user-assistant turn cycles. For example, if you have registered tools,
elmer will automatically handle the tool calling loop, which may result in
any number of additional cycles. Learn more about tool calling in
\code{vignette("tool-calling")}.
